## Code of Conduct

Help me keep this template open and inclusive.
Please read and follow [Code of Conduct][coc].

## Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as i want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

## Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue.
Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

## Missing a Feature?

You can *request* a new feature by submitting an issue.
If you would like to *implement* a new feature, you can submit an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed.
